# AngElectron

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.
This project uses Electron to run

# What does this do
This app aims to do one thing : compute stats similar to the ones you'll find on the slippi desktop app, but for multiple files at once.
The goal here is to provide players with valuable insight regarding their gameplay, to help them work on their weaker sides.

A few extra functionalities have been added to help assessing progress between sessions, be it one vs one stats comparisons, or via a graph display when considering bigger datasets

# To Run : 

npm run electron

# To Install : 

Simply download the appropriate zip in the release tab, extract it and run the exe.

# Built upon :

Built upon https://github.com/vinceau/slippi-stats for the extremely neat visual identity

Built upon https://github.com/project-slippi for the data sources

# Roadmap :

Rework the graph screen to work with the new UX / visuals

Make some better pics for the change character overlay / stages

New stats : 

Wavedash angles maybe ?

Aerial Interrupts ? Take into account ledgecancels somehow for l cancel rates and a separate stat ?
